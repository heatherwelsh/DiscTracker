<p>Disc golf is a flying disc game in which individual players throw a flying
  disc at a target. According to the Professional Disc Golf Association,
  "The object of the game is to traverse a course from beginning to end in
  the fewest number of throws of the disc."[2] Of the more than 3000
  established disc golf courses as of 2010, approximately 87% are free.
  The number of disc golf courses has more than doubled in 8 years from 2000
  to 2008.[3] The game is played in about 40 countries around the world</p>
